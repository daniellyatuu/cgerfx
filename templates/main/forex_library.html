            <p>Absolute Return</p>
            <p>An investment objective that aims to generate positive returns, regardless of the overall direction of markets/asset classes etc. Absolute Return is distinct from traditional fund managers, who benchmark their returns to an
              Index/Sector or even a Factor.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>ADR</p>
            <p>An ADR allows US investors easier access to ownership of foreign public companies. They are also beneficial for foreign companies as they enhance investor interest in their shares beyond their own domestic market.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Alpha</p>
            <p>Alpha is a measure of the performance of an investment in relation to a benchmark index. Often specified as a percentage, an alpha of 1% means that the return on investment was 1% better than the benchmark.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Alternative Investment Market</p>
            <p>The Alternative Investment Market (AIM) was first established in 1995 by the London Stock Exchange as a way for newer firms to gain access to public funds.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>Amortization</p>
            <p>Amortization has two distinct meanings: (1) In one sense, it is the practice of reducing the value of assets to properly reflect their value over time. (2) In another, it can mean the servicing of debt in regular increments.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Annuity</p>
            <p>An annuity is a product that can provide you with a lifetime income, typically on retirement. Annuities are viewed as a way to hedge against longevity risk, or the potential for one to outlive one’s invested assets. Social Security
              and/or defined pension benefits are prominent examples of annuities.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Asset Allocation</p>
            <p>An investment strategy that weights different assets in a portfolio according to an agreed investment policy that balances risks and returns. Percentages are allocated to each asset grouping according to a predetermined investment
              strategy dependent on the investors’ risk tolerance. The allocation could be described as Cautious, Balanced or Aggressive.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Auditor</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>B/C Share Scheme</p>
            <p>Companies occasionally hand cash back to shareholders by issuing new types of shares, typically called B shares and C shares, and hence deemed a B/C share scheme. Each shareholder has the choice of which type of share they wish to
              receive.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Backtesting</p>
            <p>Backtesting is a method for assessing the validity of an investment strategy by using historical data to see how an asset (or portfolio of assets) would have performed in past periods. If results were successful, it might encourage
              traders to use that strategy going forward.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Backwardation</p>
            <p>If the current cash price for an asset slips above the price for forward delivery, that’s known as ‘backwardation’.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>Bank Of England</p>
            <p>The Bank of England is the UK’s central bank. It started life in 1694 as a private bank set up by London merchants as a vehicle to lend money to the government and to deal with the national debt.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Beta</p>
            <p>Beta (or the ‘beta coefficient’) is a way to measure the relative riskiness of a share.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bid-offer spread</p>
            <p>The bid-offer spread, sometimes called the bid-ask spread, is simply the difference between the price at which you can buy a share and the price at which you can sell it.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Big Bang</p>
            <p>The Big Bang refers to the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange (LSE), which took place on 27 October 1986.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Blockchain</p>
            <p>Blockchain, and the related concept of cryptocurrency, are phrases that have been thrown around a lot in recent years, following the success of Bitcoin. As a relatively new concept, blockchain technology has great potential in all
              manner of computing-related fields, which nowadays is almost all of them. Blockchain is a new system for keeping records, but its relevance to trading and its great potential aren’t immediately obvious.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bond Auction</p>
            <p>When governments want to raise money, they do so through a bond auction by issuing bills (typically short-term) and bonds (longer term – maturities can reach 30 years or more).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bond Duration</p>
            <p>Bond duration is a measure of how long it will take to reach a bond’s mid point in cash-flow terms. For example, if a bond’s duration is 3.6 years, that specifies that one will receive one’s original investment back in that length of
              time through its coupon payments (assuming no default).</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bond Rating</p>
            <p>The risk of default on bonds varies from issuer to issuer. Credit-rating agencies provide these securities with a bond rating to help you gauge their risks.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bond Vigilantes</p>
            <p>Bond vigilantes refer to market participants who effectively self-regulate interest rates via the buying and selling of bonds in accordance with their perceived intrinsic value.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bond Yields</p>
            <p>An investor buying a bond needs to know what return to expect. The most common form of bond yields – annual yield on a fixed income security – is determined by taking the annual coupon payouts and dividing them by the market price of
              the bond.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bonds</p>
            <p>Bond trading offers opportunities to diversify investment portfolios. Bond ETFs, for example, follow an index and are a popular equity product among active traders. This guide explains the different options available, their respective
              merits and risks, plus the top bond trading brokers in [year].</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bonus Issue</p>
            <p>A bonus issue is common among British companies, wherein free additional shares are added to the positions of existing shareholders. Bonus issues are synonymous with scrip issues or capitalization issues.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Book Value</p>
            <p>Book value is the total value of the net assets of a company attributable to – or owned by – shareholders. It is calculated as the net asset value of a company, defined as the total tangible asset base (i.e., total assets minus
              intangible assets) minus total liabilities.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Bottom-up investing</p>
            <p>Bottom-up investing is a strategy that overlooks the significance of industry or economic factors and instead focuses on the analyses of individual stocks and companies.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>CAPEX Capital Expenditure</p>
            <p>Capital Expenditure (or CAPEX) is money used by a company to buy, maintain or up-grade its fixed assets, be they newly acquired buildings, land or equipment.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Capital Ratio</p>
            <p>Capital Ratio is a measurement of the amount of Equity and Debt funding required to maintain a given level of assets within a firm. Generally, the higher the ratio, the more a company has borrowed (either by raising equity or borrowing
              money) as a proportion of its total assets.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model</p>
            <p>The Capital Asset Pricing Model establishes the link between the expected return for an asset and systematic risk. The CAPM uses a simple mathematical formula. Although debunked and not widely used anymore, this pricing model is
              conceptually sound.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Cash Flow</p>
            <p>Cash flow is the amount of money both going into, and out of, a company during the course of a period, normally a financial year.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Clearing House</p>
            <p>A Clearing House is an intermediary entity acting as a trade-facilitator between the buyer and the seller in the financial markets. An indispensable cog in the system, the clearing house settles buyer/seller accounts, collects margin,
              clears trades and reports trading data to all parties concerned.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Commodity Forwards</p>
            <p>Forward contracts are non-standardised agreements between two parties, concerning the future delivery of a commodity for a presently set price. Commodity forwards contracts are customisable. They are not traded through centralised
              exchanges and are therefore considered to be OTC (over the counter) instruments.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Contango</p>
            <p>Contango: A situation most common in commodity futures markets, whereby the price for delivery in the future is above that of the spot (or price for immediate delivery). In this situation, the market is implying higher prices in the
              future, resulting in an upward sloping forward curve. As the futures contract gets closer to expiry, the price will converge (downwards) to the spot price.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Convertible Bonds</p>
            <p>Convertible Bonds are bonds issued by Corporations that can be converted into shares in the firm should the holder so prefer. In return for this opportunity, their yields tend to be below that of non-convertible bonds but above the
              yields available on the common stock. They can be seen as a bond with a stock call option attached.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Convexity</p>
            <p>Convexity is a concept in finance where there are non-linearities in a potential output after adjusting an input variable.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Correlation</p>
            <p>Correlation describes the mutual relationship between two independent values. The most basic use of correlation in trading is in finding out whether there’s a relationship between two variables and, if there is, what kind of
              relationship it is. The number is generally given as a figure between -1 and 1, where -1 implies a negative correlation, 0 represents no correlation whatsoever, and 1 implies a positive correlation.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Covered Bonds</p>
            <p>Covered Bonds: A type of derivative instrument, normally issued by a financial institution, that are collateralised by an underlying pool of investments. It can be seen as a conventional corporate bond with added collateral protection
              for the investors.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Credit Default Swap (CDS)</p>
